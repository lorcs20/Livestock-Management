# Livestock-Management
My final year project is titled “Livestock Management with OpenCV and a UAV (Drone)”. The goal
of this project was to analyse the first-person view from a UAV and process it in real time using
OpenCV to create functionality such as detecting and counting objects in motion.

I decided to take this project goal and base it around the revolutionary use of drones in agriculture.
During this project, I focused on the recognition and detection of livestock animals such as cattle
and sheep. Combining techniques of machine learning, image processing and python
programming, I was able to train my own object detection models to recognise livestock. With
the aid of the OpenCV library I was able to apply these object detection models to the eyes of a
drone while highlighting and counting each of the livestock animals in frame.

With the autonomous flight feature of a drone and an accurate object detection model, a project
such as this could prove useful in livestock farming as it would simplify the process of, e.g., keeping
count on various livestock animals and general monitoring of livestock.
